# Hexapad

A DIY macropad made for the [Hack Club](https://hack.club) [Hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com) program! It's got 16 Cherry MX switches, a "jewel" of 3 THT NeoPixels, a rotary encoder, and an OLED screen. A I/O expander is used to make everything work. This repo holds the PCB design, case design, and KMK firmware.
